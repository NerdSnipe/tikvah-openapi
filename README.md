# OpenAPI spec for the Tikvah API

A high-performance, low-latency API that's fully compatible with the OpenAI API specification but providing Bible-based, faith-centered AI interactions. 

NOTE: All end-points should be considering BETA versions - this continues to be a not-for-profit initiative.

This repository contains an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification for the [Tikvah API](https://api-docs.tikvah.app).
